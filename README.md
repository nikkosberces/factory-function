### What is Factory Function?

- The factory function pattern is similar to constructors
- Instead of using "new" to create an object, factory functions simply set up and return the new object when you call the function

### Scope and Closure

- scope - refers to where things like variables and functions can be used in your code
- closure - is like a secret hiding spot in the toy box that only the function can access
